# Integrated Fire Detection and Personnel Accountability System

This project implements an integrated system for fire detection using deep learning (LSTM) and personnel accountability. It includes:

- Fire detection from video streams using a trained LSTM model
- Personnel tracking and accountability features
- Example media files and project documentation

## Project Structure

- `detection.py`: Main script for fire detection
- `trained_lstm_model.py`: Trained LSTM model and related code (see note below)
- `fire1.mp4`, `fire2.mp4`, `fire3.mp4`, `test1.mp4`: Example video files
- `*.pdf`, `*.pptx`: Project reports and presentations

## Getting Started

1. Install required Python packages (see code for dependencies)
2. Run `detection.py` to start fire detection
